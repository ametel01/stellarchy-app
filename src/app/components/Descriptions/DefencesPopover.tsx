                    Blasters are your initial defense, firing conventional
                    warhead missiles at enemy targets from ground-based
                    facilities. Being inexpensive to build and requiring no
                    research, they're perfect for warding off raids, though less
                    effective against larger-scale attacks. As you advance in
                    constructing more potent defense systems, these Blasters act
                    as simple buffers, letting your more powerful weapons cause
                    greater damage for extended periods.

                    Once regarded as outdated amid thermonuclear and energy
                    technology, projectile weapons have regained prominence
                    thanks to advancements in the very energy technology that
                    had aged them. The Astral Launcher, a grand particle
                    accelerator, epitomizes this revival. Launching extremely
                    heavy missiles with enormous electromagnetic force, it
                    creates muzzle velocities that ignite the surrounding dirt
                    and produces a sonic boom. Modern armor and shields often
                    fail against this mighty force, and targets may be fully
                    penetrated by a missile's power. Defence structures
                    deactivate when too badly damaged.

                    The Plasma Projector, one of the most advanced defense
                    weapons, is your first basic line of defense. Using a
                    nuclear reactor fuel cell, it superheats and compresses
                    gases to create a plasma sphere. This sphere is then
                    launched by an electromagnetic accelerator at incredible
                    speed. Upon targeting and firing, the plasma sphere streaks
                    towards its target, causing instant destruction upon impact.
                    Its bluish appearance is as impressive as its lethal
                    efficiency.
