                    Enhancing on-board weaponry improves a transporter's
                    freighting capacity but doesn't prepare it for combat.
                    Therefore, it should only enter battle zones when
                    accompanied by combat-ready ships, ensuring protection and
                    support while fulfilling its logistical role.

                    Scientists developed celestias in geosynchronous orbit to
                    transmit electrical energy to colonies. These celestias
                    capture solar energy and relay it to ground stations using
                    advanced lasers. While they offer a cost-effective energy
                    solution, they are vulnerable in battle. Every unit produced
                    adds 15 energy units.

                    Space combat led to thousands of ships lost in debris
                    fields, unreachable by normal cargo ships. However, new
                    shield technologies enabled the creation of Scrapers, a

                    All emperors will build the light fighter as their first

                    become a significant threat to any empire when amassed in
                    large numbers. They are typically deployed to accompany

                    utilized against sparrows groups, frigates no longer hold

                    When the frigates began losing ground to growing defense
                    structures and suffered unacceptable levels of ship loss, a
                    decision was made to create a vessel that could confront
                    these defenses with minimal casualties. This led to the
                    development of the Armade, a ship engineered to endure the
                    most substantial battles. Equipped with large cargo spaces,
                    heavy cannons, and a high warp drive speed, the Armade was
                    designed to meet these challenges head-on. Once completed,
                    it became the essential component of every raiding Emperor's
                    fleet, symbolizing both strength and innovation.
